Redux Toolkit is used instead of traditional Redux for several reasons, primarily aimed at simplifying the development process and improving the developer experience. Here are the key reasons why Redux Toolkit is preferred:

1. Reduced Boilerplate Code
Traditional Redux: Setting up a Redux store involves defining actions, action creators, reducers, and types separately, leading to a lot of boilerplate code.
Redux Toolkit: With functions like createSlice, you can define the state, reducers, and actions all in one place, significantly reducing the amount of code you need to write.
2. Simplified Store Configuration
Traditional Redux: You need to set up middleware, enhancers, and the store configuration manually, which can be error-prone and cumbersome.
Redux Toolkit: The configureStore function automatically sets up best practices, including middleware (like Redux Thunk) and integration with Redux DevTools, making it easier to get started.
3. Built-in Support for Immutability
Traditional Redux: You have to ensure that you donâ€™t mutate the state directly, which can lead to mistakes.
Redux Toolkit: It uses Immer under the hood, allowing you to write "mutating" code in reducers. Immer takes care of producing a new immutable state behind the scenes, making it easier to manage state updates.
4. Easier Asynchronous Logic
Traditional Redux: Managing asynchronous actions typically requires writing action types and thunk functions separately.
Redux Toolkit: With createAsyncThunk, you can define asynchronous actions more cleanly, managing their lifecycle (pending, fulfilled, rejected) automatically and integrating them with reducers.
5. Encourages Best Practices
Traditional Redux: Developers often struggle to apply best practices consistently due to the complexity of setup.
Redux Toolkit: It promotes best practices by providing a more structured and opinionated way of writing Redux logic. This helps avoid common pitfalls and encourages more maintainable code.
6. Improved Developer Experience
Traditional Redux: Learning and using Redux can be overwhelming for newcomers due to its complexity.
Redux Toolkit: It provides a more intuitive API and better documentation, making it easier for developers, especially those new to Redux, to understand and use effectively.
7. Easier Testing
Traditional Redux: Testing can involve dealing with multiple files and managing state transitions manually.
Redux Toolkit: The organization of slices and their actions makes it easier to write tests for your state management logic.
Summary
Redux Toolkit simplifies and streamlines the process of working with Redux, making it the recommended way to use Redux in modern applications. It reduces boilerplate, provides built-in best practices, and enhances the overall developer experience, making state management more accessible and efficient.
